## Welcome!

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## Challenge done
  This is a multi-step form where the user purchases a subscription based on their needs.

Users can:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to the previous step to update the selections
- See a summary of their choices in the final stage and finally their order is confirmed.
- Depending on the screen size of the device, you will see the optimal layout of the interface
- View hover and focus status for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
    - A string is missing
    - The email address is not formatted correctly
    - The step has been submitted, but no selections have been made

### What I learned
While working with this project, my programming skills improved and I enjoyed writing more and newer code in the high-level JavaScript language. I advise people who have not done such forms to believe in their abilities and create better projects.
